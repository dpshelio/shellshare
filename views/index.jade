    h2 Frequently asked questions
    h3 Can someone control my terminal through shellshare?
    p.
      No. All communication is just one-way: from your terminal to shellshare.
      There's no way someone could send commands to your terminal. If you'd
      like to allow it, try <a
      href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/screen">screen</a> or <a
      href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a> (specially with <a
      href="http://tmate.io">tmate</a>).
    h3 Can I save the broadcast?
    p.
      No. Shellshare was made only for live broadcasts. If you'd like to save your terminal, try
      <a href="https://asciinema.org">asciinema.org</a>.
    h3 Can I broadcast to a custom room name?
    p
      | Yes. You can broadcast to a named room secured with a password by calling shellshare as:
      pre
        code.
          $ <span class="macos">curl -sLo</span><span class="linux">wget -qO</span> shellshare https://get.shellshare.net
          $ python shellshare --room MY-ROOM --password MY-PASS
          <span class="shell-output">Sharing terminal in https://shellshare.net/r/MY-ROOM</span>
          $ # ...
          $ exit
          <span class="shell-output">End of transmission.</span>
      | If you don't set a password, shellshare will use your network card's MAC
      | address to uniquely identify your computer. This means you'll be able to
      | transmit to the same room later only if you're using the same computer.
    h3 Can I recover the password to a custom room?
    p.
      No. However, the rooms are deleted after a day of inactivity, so you can recreate it in 24 hours.
    h3 Can I install shellshare from my package manager?
    p
      | We currently have a shellshare package on Homebrew only. If you use
      | Homebrew, you can install shellshare using:
      pre
        code.
          brew install shellshare
      | If you'd like to contribute, we have an <a
      | href="https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare/issues/28"
      | rel="external">open issue to create a Debian package</a>.
    h3 Can I run shellshare on Windows?
    p.
      Yes. On the first time shellshare runs, it will download the required
      dependency into <span>.shellshare/script.exe</span> in your user's home
      folder. This executable will be used in the next times you run
      shellshare.
    h3 I found a problem! What do I do?
    p.
      Please, open an issue at our <a
      href="https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare/issues">issues page</a>
      describing what the problem was, your shellshare version, and your operating
      system.
    h3 How can I help?
    p.
      Great! Any help is appreciated. Check out the code on <a
      href="https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare">GitHub</a> and the <a
      href="https://github.com/vitorbaptista/shellshare/issues">issues
      page</a>. If you find anything that could be improved, go ahead, create an
      issue and send me a pull request.
